SALE DATA ANALYSIS

The Orion Star is a global retailer that offers sporting goods and outdoor. 
There are retail locations for Orion Star in many countries including Belgium, Holland, Germany, the United Kingdom, etc. 
The corporate headquarters manages stock management, import, export, and Internet sales. 
Nearly 5500 distinct sports and outdoor products are manufactured by the company. This project is known as "Orion's Sword," or simply Sword. 
Orion Star has asked that the Sword project kick off with the creation of a Sales Data Mart because they are eager to capitalize on the power of data warehousing. 

 The purpose of this project is to create an ETL framework to address business intelligence issues and assist the company in gaining a general understanding of the status of the sales based on historical sales data. 
 Although the retail sector is crucial to the economy, it is also extremely vulnerable to failure.
